                    Recently graduated computer engineer with a strong passion for
                    software development. I have several years of experience
                    volunteering in organizations, and over two years of relevant job
                    experience. My special expertise include building and delivering
                    full-stack solutions on the web, solving complex problems
                    programmatically, as well as engineering robust database
                    solutions. The next item on my bucket list is securing an
                    interesting and challenging career with both horizontal and
                    vertical growth opportunities.
